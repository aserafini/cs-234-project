# cs-234-project

JC, Anav, and Arianna train an RL agent to learn to change the learning rate to help another network learn to tell the difference between numbers

It didn't work.

The gang is back and this time it's personal. They're here to train another RL agent and oh man wait 'till you here about this one. 

*slaps policy gradient* This bad boy can update so many gosh darn parameters of this *slaps roof of vanilla neural network* bad boy which knows a pretty good amount about the numbers 1-10.

Stay... tuned.
